# Developer Toolkit

## Overview

This is a toolkit of programs and scripts used for developing and testing in Unix and Linux environments.  It contains several command-line utilities and libraries implemented in C, some shell script packages and other components that have been helpful to me as a developer.  It is an on-going project so it will continue to grow and change as I continue to work on it. Most of these things developed from my work in all kinds of Unix and Linux environments.
